# Bayesian Regression with Count Data

Leaving the universe of linear models, we start to venture into generalized linear models (GLM). The second of these is
**regression with count data** (also called Poisson regression).

A regression with count data behaves exactly like a linear model: it makes a prediction simply by computing a weighted
sum of the independent variables $\mathbf{X}$ by the estimated coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$, plus an intercept
$\alpha$. However, instead of returning a continuous value $y$, such as linear regression, it returns the **natural
log** of $y$.

We use regression with count data when our dependent variable is restricted to positive integers, *i.e.* $y \in \mathbb{Z}^+$.
See the figure below for a graphical intuition of the exponential function:

```julia:ex1
using Plots, LaTeXStrings

plot(exp, -6, 6, label=false,
     xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"e^x")
savefig(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "exponential.svg")); # hide
```

\fig{exponential}
\center{*Exponential Function*} \\

As we can see, the exponential function is basically a mapping of any real number to a
positive real number in the range between 0 and $+\infty$ (non-inclusive):

$$ \text{Exponential}(x) = \{ \mathbb{R} \in [- \infty , + \infty] \} \to \{ \mathbb{R} \in [0, + \infty] \} $$

That is, the exponential function is the ideal candidate for when we need to convert something continuous without restrictions
to something continuous restricted to taking positive values only. That is why it is used when we need a model to have a
positive-only dependent variable. This is the case of a dependent variable for count data.

## Comparison with Linear Regression

Linear regression follows the following mathematical formulation:

$$ \text{Linear} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n $$

* $\theta$ - model parameters
  * $\theta_0$ - intercept
  * $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dots$ - independent variables $x_1, x_2, \dots$ coefficients
* $n$ - total number of independent variables

Regression with count data would add the exponential function to the linear term:

$$ \log(y) = \theta_0 \cdot \theta_1 x_1 \cdot \theta_2 x_2 \cdot \dots \cdot \theta_n x_n $$

which is the same as:

$$ y = e^{(\theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1 + \theta_2 x_2 + \ldots + \theta_n x_n)} $$

## Bayesian Regression with Count Data

We can model regression with count data in two ways. The first option with a **Poisson likelihood** function
and the second option with a **negative binomial likelihood** function.

With the **Poisson likelihood** we model a discrete and positive dependent variable $y$ by assuming that a given number of
independent $y$ events will occur with a known constant average rate.

In a **negative binomial likelihood**, model a discrete and positive dependent variable $y$ by assuming that a given number $n$ of
independent $y$ events will occur by asking a yes-no question for each $n$ with probability $p$ until $k$ success(es) is obtained.
Note that it becomes identical to the Poisson likelihood when at the limit of $k \to \infty$. This makes the negative binomial a
**robust option to replace a Poisson likelihood** to model phenomena with a *overdispersion* (excess expected variation in data).
This occurs due to the Poisson likelihood making an assumption that the dependent variable $y$ has the same mean and variance,
while in the negative binomial likelihood the mean and the variance do not need to be equal.

### Using Poisson Likelihood

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y} &\sim \text{Poisson}\left( e^{(\alpha + \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta})} \right) \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_\alpha, \sigma_\alpha) \\
\boldsymbol{\beta} &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, \sigma_{\boldsymbol{\beta}})
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

* $\mathbf{y}$ -- discrete and positive dependent variable.
* $e$ -- exponential.
* $\alpha$ -- intercept.
* $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ -- coefficient vector.
* $\mathbf{X}$ -- data matrix.

As we can see, the linear predictor $\alpha + \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}$ is the logarithm of the value of
$y$. So we need to apply the exponential function the values of the linear predictor:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log(\mathbf{y}) &= \alpha + \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta} \\
\mathbf{y} &= e^{\alpha \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta}} \\
\mathbf{y} &= e^{\alpha} \cdot e^{\left( \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta} \right) }
\end{aligned}
$$

The intercept $\alpha$ and coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are only interpretable after exponentiation.

### Using Negative Binomial Likelihood

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{y} &\sim \text{Negative Binomial}\left( e^{(\alpha + \mathbf{X} \cdot \boldsymbol{\beta})}, \phi \right) \\
\phi &= \frac{1}{\phi^-} \\
\phi^- &\sim \text{Gamma}(0.01, 0.01) \\
\alpha &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_\alpha, \sigma_\alpha) \\
\boldsymbol{\beta} &\sim \text{Normal}(\mu_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}, \sigma_{\boldsymbol{\beta}})
\end{aligned}
$$

where:

* $\mathbf{y}$ -- discrete and positive dependent variable.
* $e$ -- exponential.
* $\phi$ -- dispersion.
* $\phi^-$ -- reciprocal dispersion.
* $\alpha$ -- intercept.
* $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ -- coefficient vector.
* $\mathbf{X}$ -- data matrix.

Note that when we compare with the Poisson model, we have a new parameter $\phi$ that parameterizes the negative binomial
likelihood. This parameter is the probability of successes $p$ of the negative binomial distribution and we generally use
a Gamma distribution as prior so that the inverse of $\phi$ which is $\phi^-$ fulfills the function of a "reciprocal dispersion"
parameter. Most of the time we use a weakly informative prior of the parameters shape $\alpha = 0.01$ and scale $\theta = 0.01$
(Gelman et al., 2013; 2020). But you can also use $\phi^- \sim \text{Exponential}(1)$ as prior (McElreath, 2020).

Here is what a $\text{Gamma}(0.01, 0.01)$ looks like:

```julia:ex2
using StatsPlots, Distributions
plot(Gamma(0.01, 0.01),
        lw=2, label=false,
        xlabel=L"\phi",
        ylabel="Density",
        xlims=(0, 0.01))
savefig(joinpath(@OUTPUT, "gamma.svg")); # hide
```

\fig{gamma}
\center{*Gamma Distribution with $\alpha = 0.01$ and $\theta = 0.01$*} \\

In both likelihood options, what remains is to specify the model parameters' prior distributions:

* Prior Distribution of $\alpha$ -- Knowledge we possess regarding the model's intercept.
* Prior Distribution of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$  -- Knowledge we possess regarding the model's independent variables' coefficients.

Our goal is to instantiate a regression with count data using the observed data ($\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{X}$) and find the posterior
distribution of our model's parameters of interest ($\alpha$ and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$). This means to find the full posterior
distribution of:

$$ P(\boldsymbol{\theta} \mid \mathbf{y}) = P(\alpha, \boldsymbol{\beta} \mid \mathbf{y}) $$

Note that contrary to the linear regression, which used a Gaussian/normal likelihood function, we don't have an error
parameter $\sigma$ in our regression with count data. This is due to neither the Poisson nor negative binomial distributions having
a "scale" parameter such as the $\sigma$ parameter in the Gaussian/normal distribution.

This is easily accomplished with Turing:

```julia:ex3
using Turing
using LazyArrays
using Random:seed!
seed!(123)
setprogress!(false) # hide

@model negbinreg(X,  y; predictors=size(X, 2)) = begin
	#priors
	α ~ Normal(0, 2.5)
	β ~ filldist(TDist(3), predictors)

	#likelihood
	y ~ arraydist(LazyArray(@~ LogPoisson.(α .+ X * β)))
end;
```

Here I am specifying very weakly informative priors:

* $\alpha \sim \text{Normal}(0, 2.5)$ -- This means a normal distribution centered on 0 with a standard deviation of 2.5. That prior should with ease cover all possible values of $\alpha$. Remember that the normal distribution has support over all the real number line $\in (-\infty, +\infty)$.
* $\boldsymbol{\beta} \sim \text{Student-}t(0,1,3)$ -- The predictors all have a prior distribution of a Student-$t$ distribution centered on 0 with variance 1 and degrees of freedom $\nu = 3$. That wide-tailed $t$ distribution will cover all possible values for our coefficients. Remember the Student-$t$ also has support over all the real number line $\in (-\infty, +\infty)$. Also the `filldist()` is a nice Turing's function which takes any univariate or multivariate distribution and returns another distribution that repeats the input distribution.

Turing's `arraydist()` function wraps an array of distributions returning a new distribution sampling from the individual
distributions. And the LazyArrays' `LazyArray()` constructor wrap a lazy object that wraps a computation producing an array
to an array. Last, but not least, the macro `@~` creates a broadcast and is a nice short hand for the familiar dot `.`
broadcasting operator in Julia. This is an efficient way to tell Turing that our `y` vector is distributed lazily as a
`LogPoisson` broadcasted to `α` added to the product of the data matrix `X` and `β` coefficient vector. `LogPoisson` is
Turing's efficient distribution that already apply exponentiation to all the linear predictors.

If you want to use the negative binomial likelihood in your model you change or add the following lines:

```julia
ϕ⁻ ~ Gamma(0.01, 0.01) # or Exponential(1)
ϕ = 1 / ϕ⁻
y ~ arraydist(LazyArray(@~ NegativeBinomial.(exp.(α .+ X * β), ϕ)))
```

## Example - Roaches Extermination

For our example, I will use a famous dataset called `roaches` (Gelman & Hill, 2007), which is data on the efficacy of a
pest management system at reducing the number of roaches in urban apartments.
It has 262 observations and the following variables:

* `y` -- number of roaches caught.
* `roach1` -- pretreatment number of roaches.
* `treatment` -- binary/dummy (0 or 1) for treatment indicator.
* `senior` -- binary/dummy (0 or 1) for only elderly residents in building.
* `exposure2` -- number of days for which the roach traps were used

Ok let's read our data with `CSV.jl` and output into a `DataFrame` from `DataFrames.jl`:

```julia:ex4
using DataFrames, CSV, HTTP

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storopoli/Bayesian-Julia/master/datasets/roaches.csv"
roaches = CSV.read(HTTP.get(url).body, DataFrame)
describe(roaches)
```

As you can see from the `describe()` output the average number of roaches caught by the pest management system is around 26 roaches.
The average number of roaches pretreatment is around 42 roaches (oh boy...).
30% of the buildings has only elderly residents and 60% of the buildings received a treatment by the pest management system.
Also note that the traps were set in general for only 1 day and it ranges from 0.2 days (almost 5 hours) to 4.3 days
(which is approximate 4 days and 7 hours).

Now let's us instantiate our model with the data:

```julia:ex5
X = Matrix(select(roaches, Not(:y)))
y = roaches[:, :y]
model = negbinreg(X, y);
```

And, finally, we will sample from the Turing model. We will be using the default `NUTS()` sampler with `2_000` samples, with
4 Markov chains using multiple threads `MCMCThreads()`:

```julia:ex6
chain = sample(model, NUTS(), MCMCThreads(), 2_000, 4)
summarystats(chain)
```

We had no problem with the Markov chains as all the `rhat` are well below `1.01` (or above `0.99`).
Note that the coefficients are in log scale. So we need to apply the exponential function to them.
We can do this with a transformation in a `DataFrame` constructed from a `Chains` object:

```julia:ex7
using Chain

@chain quantile(chain) begin
	DataFrame
    select(_,
        :parameters,
        names(_, r"%") .=> ByRow(exp),
        renamecols=false)
end
```

Let's analyze our results. The intercept `α` is the basal number of roaches caught `y` and has
a median value of 19.4 roaches caught. The remaining 95% credible intervals for the `β`s can be interpreted as follows:

* `β[1]` -- first column of `X`, `roach1`, has 95% credible interval 1.01 to 1.01. This means that each **increase** in one unit of `roach1` is related to an increase of 1% more roaches caught.
* `β[2]` -- second column of `X`, `treatment`, has 95% credible interval 0.57 to 0.63. This means that if an apartment was treated with the pest management system then we expect an **decrease** of around 40% roaches caught.
* `β[3]` -- third column of `X`, `senior`, has a 95% credible interval from 0.64 to 0.73. This means that if an apartment building has only elderly residents then we expect an **decrease** of around 30% roaches caught.
* `β[4]` -- fourth column of `X`, `exposure2`, has a 95% credible interval from 1.09 to 1.26. Each increase in one day for the exposure of traps in an apartment we expect an **increase** of between 9% to 26% roaches caught.

That's how you interpret 95% credible intervals from a `quantile()` output of a regression with count data `Chains`
object converted from a log scale.
